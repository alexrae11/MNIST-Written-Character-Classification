# MNIST-Written-Character-Classification

As part of my machine learning coursework I had to do the following:

1.Evaluate and articulate the issues and challenges in machine learning, including model selection, complexity and feature selection.

2.Demonstrate a working knowledge of the variety of mathematical techniques normally adopted for machine learning problems, and of their application to creating effective solutions.

3.Critically evaluate the performance and drawbacks of a proposed solution to a machine learning problem.

4.Create solutions to machine learning problems using appropriate software.

This was achieved by applying existing algorithms in R to the MNIST machine learning problem and dataset. 

The following criteria was required:

-Image data from the data set needs to be loaded and preprocessed.

-Apply appropriate dimension reduction techniques for visualization of the data set. 

-Use pre-processed and dimension-reduced data to train a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) classifier on the dataset.

-Use appropriate statistical tools to estimate its classification error and determine which value of k is best suited for the task. 

-Choose one additional, suitable classification algorithm and evaluate its effectiveness on the dataset.
